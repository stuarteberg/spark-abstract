The emerging field of connectomics aims to unlock the mysteries of brain by understanding the connectivity between neurons.
To extract this connectivty, we acquire thousands of electron microscopy (EM) images with nanometer resolution, which reveals neuronal shapes and their connections via synapses.

However, acquiring the large image data and the subsequent extraction of connectivity information is time consuming.
Even studying the brains of small organisms like fruit flies requires terabytes of image data and years of effort entailing manually examining images and tracing neural connections.


To reduce the time-consuming manual effort required to extract neural connectivity, we apply cutting-edge image segmentation algorithms to automatically segment neurons from the EM dataset.

In particular, we propose a novel strategy to segment large neurons that exceed the capacity of a single machine, while being robust to potential segmentation errors that arise from data anomalies and regions with little representation in the training data that likely occur in a large dataset.

To process a very large dataset, we implement a Spark application that runs batch segmentation, at scale, on several overlapping subvolumes and implements a global algorithm for stitching these subvolumes together.
We also implement functionality for analyzing the quality of this segmentation at scale.
Our results correctly segment significant portions of many neurons spanning a large dataset.

Our implementation exposes flexible segmentation configuration and supports a plugin-architecture for custom contributions to parts of the segmentation workflow.
Other key aspects of our solution include
a) fast compression and serialization of large numpy datastructures,
b) rollback mechanisms to enable mid-application recovery needed for long-running Spark applications,
and 3) a library for reading/writing data through the image-oriented, versioned data service called DVID.
